# Conclusions

## Findings

1. Duplications of products in the cart were found when running the tests automatically via script, suggesting a possible issue in the application's logic for adding products to the cart.
2. Additional products are sometimes added to the cart when running the tests via script.
3. Confirmation messages and general functionality for adding products to the cart work correctly when performed manually.
4. The functionality for placing an order and receiving a confirmation message works as expected.

## Recommendations

1. Review and resolve the issue of product duplication and the addition of extra products when adding products to the cart via script.
2. Ensure that confirmation messages are consistent and clear to users.
3. Perform more tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
