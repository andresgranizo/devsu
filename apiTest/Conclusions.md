# Conclusions

During the execution of the tests for the PetStore API, the following observations were made:

1. **Adding a New Pet:**
   - The API endpoint `POST /pet` successfully added a new pet to the store.
   - The response was as expected, returning the correct pet details and a status code of 200.

2. **Finding a Pet by ID:**
   - The API endpoint `GET /pet/{petId}` correctly retrieved the pet details using the provided pet ID.

3. **Updating Pet Status:**
   - The API endpoint `PUT /pet` successfully updated the status of the pet to "sold".
   - The response contained the updated pet details.

4. **Finding Pets by Status:**
   - The API endpoint `GET /pet/findByStatus?status=sold` correctly listed all pets with the status "sold".
   - The response included the updated pet.

All tests were executed successfully, and no errors were encountered during the testing process. The PetStore API demonstrated consistent and reliable behavior across all tested endpoints.
